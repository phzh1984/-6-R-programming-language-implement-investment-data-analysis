#R programming language implements investment data analysis

This project deals with modeling the selection of stocks, bonds, and cash to make up an investment portfolio. 

The ROI column is the percentage predicted return on investment, the Risk column is a measure of the risk associated with this particular investment, and the Type indicates the type of investment.  Note that each row is labeled with the type of investment and a number so that you can (if needed) refer to individual investments.
